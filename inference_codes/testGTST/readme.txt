This code is for ISBI2021 6th Cell Segmentation and Tracking Challenge secondary track
# Instructions

## Setting up environment

Using Anaconda 3 (or miniconda3) on linux, run the following:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cell_test_rina
```

The Anaconda environment was tested on Linux with CUDA 10.2.

## Running the code

Run the following command `./<dataset-name>.sh`; where `<dataset-name>` is the cell dataset name. In this submission, the following datasets were considered:

- [x] `BF-C2DL-HSC`
- [x] `BF-C2DL-MuSC`
- [x] `Fluo-N2DL-HeLa`
- [x] `PhC-C2DL-PSC`
- [x] `DIC-C2DH-HeLa`
- [x] `PhC-C2DH-U373`
- [x] `Fluo-N2DH-GOWT1`
- [x] `PhC-C2DL-PSC`


Thanks!
